1. Put together a heatmap of each state's total donations on a MAP of the United States. The darker the color, the more money each state gave.  
2. Make statistics of the donation trend of the three candidates who received the most donations, and use a broken line chart to show it. The horizontal axis represents the time and the vertical axis represents the amount of donations.  
3. Analyze the candidate who has received the most money and create a word cloud of the names of that candidate's donors.
